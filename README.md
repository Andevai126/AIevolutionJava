# AIevolutionJava
A test with neural networks, object-oriented, in Java, learns by Evolution.

## Usage
1. Start the application.
   ```sh
   java App
   ```
2. Make the opened window full-screen.
3. Zoom with qe, move over the canvas with wasd.
4. Two red lines can be seen. The cars will start between these two lines. Connect the two openings with each other. Use the mouse to add red lines by clicking and holding at one position en letting go at another position. With other words, create a short race track.
5. Once you are happy, press 't' (test). A hosts of green 'cars' will spawn. Logs can be viewed in the console from where you started the application.

## Notes
- Although they may be hard to follow, I wrote my thoughts down in notes.txt
- Theoretically, At some point the cars should not hit a line anymore, and drive though the track whilst taking the most optimal route.
